  This article uses the Mercator projection and Delaunay triangulation method to convert the traditional gravity field structure into a triangular model. This new gravity triangulation model (GTM) divides the entire field into numerous small triangles, each representing more localized gravity spatial characteristics. Then a new gravity-matching algorithm based on the computational geometry “plane-line-point” model is proposed which can reduce the error of traditional filtering algorithms in processing nonlinear features. The optimal position estimation of the underwater vehicle is obtained through rough matching of triangular surfaces, secondary matching of intersection lines, precise matching of track points, and spatial affine transformation.
