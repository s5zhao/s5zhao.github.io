  This article introduces the sequence correlation analysis into the single point matching algorithm, and uses the sliding measurement sequence to estimate recursively. First, a position sequence estimation method based on trajectory reconstruction is proposed, which calculates the new position sequence by the relationship between INS displacement and heading angle, instead of the direct translation of INS trajectory method in traditional algorithms. After that, the likelihood of the candidate point is calculated by the correlation analysis method using the corresponding sliding measurement sequence at the current time, and a more accurate position estimation is obtained after the measurement update.
