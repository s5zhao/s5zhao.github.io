  Aiming to obtain high-precision position information in the small range adaptation area, backtracking strategies that combine the filter algorithm are first proposed in this article. Next, the observability of gravity-aided navigation system is also analyzed based on graph analysis. Furthermore, the reverse error equations are obtained by analogy corresponding to the reverse solution, and the relationship between forward navigation and reverse navigation is also given.
