   This paper proposes an improved ICCP gravity matching algorithm based on Mahalanobis distance. Mahalanobis distance, instead of Euclidean distance, is applied to improve the objective function of rigid transformation iteration in traditional ICCP algorithm, which can eliminate the interference of variable correlation.
