  This work improves the global static path-planning algorithm based on the A* algorithm, and the local dynamic path-planning algorithm based on dynamic window approach (DWA). The simulation results show that the global dynamic path-planning algorithm proposed can realise obstacle-free navigation of the underwater vehicle.
