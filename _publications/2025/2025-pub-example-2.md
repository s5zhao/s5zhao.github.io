  This article proposes a gravity disturbance calculation and compensation method based on carrier motion constraints. First, using velocity information as a constraint, a conversion model is constructed for the low-frequency signal of gravity disturbance to calculate the low-order spherical harmonic model. This model significantly reduces the time cost required for the gravity disturbance model computation. Second, addressing the misalignment between the actual navigation coordinate system and the ideal navigation coordinate system caused by gravity disturbances, a coordinate system correction algorithm based on the direction cosine matrix of disturbances is proposed.
