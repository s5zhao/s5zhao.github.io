  This article proposes a suitable matching area selection algorithm for the underwater terrain-aided inertial navigation based on terrain triangulation which converts the digital terrain map from a raster map to terrain triangulation model. This is a novel approach that extracts eight types of spatial features from a triangulation model to analyze the characteristics of terrain. Gaussian mixture model clustering method is used to automatically select and divide the suitable matching area based on the feature parameter matrix.
