  This article proposes an adaptive construction method of point mass set based on probability distribution. According to the characteristics of the probability distribution to be approximated, the method transforms the preset point mass set to obtain point mass set of the current moment. Aiming at the problem of calculation error, which is caused by the process noise intensity being smaller than the resolution of the point mass set, a local convolution method is proposed in this article, in which the convolution result is obtained by subdividing the local area near the point mass set.
