  This paper proposes a novel adaptability analysis method based on the quantification of terrain matching performance, which provides a reliable means of quantifying the terrain matching performance. First, the sources of terrain matching errors are examined and classified into two types: local error and similarity error. Then, theoretical derivations provide an analytical expression for local error, while similarity error is expressed as probability. Finally, these two errors are combined into a scalar adaptability index called adaptability error, that effectively reflects terrain matching accuracy.
